General:
--------
	- strange crash with xmms when a directory is added recursively
	  into the playlist (containing uade songs).. mld couldn't reproduce
	  this... (shd)

	- plugindir/uade.c/play_file():
	  if i change positions of audio allocation code and forkexec code
	  xmms hangs when the second uade song is going to be played (shd)

	- play CUST.FA-18_Interceptor: on xmms the sound plays mono for some
	  reason, but from the console it plays stereo.. odd.. probably some
	  very stupid mistake (shd)

	  (maybe related to the pathentry in the xmms.m3u playlist (?) 
	    Plays mono:
	    #EXTINF:900,Cust.FA-18_Interceptor [custom]
	    /mnt/linux/home/shared/sound/music/Amigaformats/Custom/Cust.FA-18_Interceptor

	    Plays stereo:
	    #EXTINF:900,Cust.FA-18_Interceptor [custom]
	    /home/shared/sound/music/Amigaformats/Custom/Cust.FA-18_Interceptor

	    Both is the same file. "/home/" is a symlink to "/mnt/linux/home"
	   (mld))

	- song length inaccuracy (grue)

	- interactive mode: play * should store full pathname into play
	  queue, because if current directory changes the entries in the
	  queue become meaningless (shd)

	- increase chip mem to 8MB to be able to play Lapsuus, but before that
	  check score & uade specific systems (shd)

	- re-do memory pre-allocation in uade.c. integrate with score. (shd)

	- visualizers die after subsong change (giulio canevari)

Player/Soundcore related:
-------------------------
	- FRED song end bugs.. FRED.S02-SummerTime (FRED.S01-Robocop, too.)
	   ends prematurely.. It seems my song end glue was not sticky enough ;)
	   (shd)

	- CUST.Wings volume bug. Beeps with voltest parameter (mld)

	- VSS eagleplayer volume bug. music plays only with voltest parameter.
	  (mld)

        - Depending on the mod PTK-Prowiz sometimes hits small values in
	  audxper, too. (mld)

	- fwmp doesn't play all songs (shd)


	- Wings of Death level 1 sub 1 has portamento bugs with the current
	  hipc player. Created a custom version to fix this (shd)

	- the first subsong of hipc.wasseremu crashes after 2 minutes. the
	  second and third don't crash (f d9dc)
		uade: song end (score crashed)
	  similar behaviour with:
		willi, enchanted land 1 (not the first sub)
	  It seems the player we use can't handle wasseremu.
	  (shd)

	- no song end with PP10.CF2_CIntro (shd)

	- find out why the some Ghostbattle hipc files from Exotica play
	  alright, while the same ones from Unexotica suffer from the same
	  problem as the hipc from Wings of death, and maybe write a
	  converter (mld)

	- is20.firefox ii (instereo 2.0) bugs.. broken samples. looks like
	  there have been problem ever since uade 0.60 (shd)

	- thomas hermann player is buggy. THM.Beam sounds correct now that
	  the load file bug was fixed on 2004.05.03. The rest of the
	  songs are dubiously played. Opinions? (shd)

	- fred player doesn't recognize fred.Nemesis without force (shd)

	- mmd1 sample bugs. see amigapop.med. (shd)

	- hear say: zabek: yoho, I found a song which misses some sound
	  events on uade (but it's with 0.80 on morphos.. maybe it's fixed
	  now). maybe you want to put it on your todo list, the song is Fire
	  and Forget 2 (customplay, can be found on exotica).. (shd)
	  MORE: the custom is buggy (corrupts memory and doesn't work
	  well with 060 caches on) (shd)

	- WingsOfDeath Title (Hippel): bg chords were not played after having
	  played some other songs in different formats before.
	  Have to investigate, which Formats collide with Hippel (mld)
	  Play PSD.GoldRunner, and then HIP.Jambala-Gameover. One gets
	  random samples in the beginning. (piru)

	- <ave_> aven biisi

	- shadow sorcerer reloc error (shd)

	- some cineware songs of Wings don't function (shd)

	- It Came From The Desert / TINY.ice does not work (shd)

	- 'tfmx/MDAT.Quick&Silva_Ingame-CH' plays with TFMX_Pro but should be
	  played with TFMX_Pro_(TFHD). 'tfmx/P_P_Hammer/mdat.ingame' does
	  not play at all. It also should be played with TFMX_PRO_(TFHD) (shd)
	  probably buggy tunes (mld)

	- aon8 might have 'timing problems', jump few cycles here and there
	  (grue)

	- Lapsuus bugs because there is not enough cpu speed without speed
	  hack (use -sh). How to enable speed hack automatically for lapsuus?
	  (shd)

	- FTM from DT 2.27 works (with -sh switch)
	  FaceTheMusic from EP 2.02 crashes (mld)

	- Maxtrax crashes with an unimplemented exec func 0xFEBA  (mld)

	- TFMX monkey island 1 differences from francesco pretto (shd)

	- score_48 fixed music maker, but broke sonix driver. the problem
	  is that extload and config are called before ep_check5. (mld)


UAE specific:
-------------
	- movem.l $b4(a6),a1/a5 gets disassembled wrong. the output is:
	    MVMEL.L #$2200,(A6,$00b4)
	  The opcode is: 4cee 2200

Probably fixed:
---------------

	- song length database bug (grue)

	- players/ENV:EaglePlayer gives hard time for MorphOS users ;) (shd)

	- ahx bug with comic bakery. halts on 00:46. But I hear so does
	  the native ahx player! So we are in full compliancy :P (shd)
	  Probl. not a bug (mld) not a bug (maj)

	- amberstar title (hip7) crashes on time index 02:41 (markey)
	  *FIXED* with Don Adan's replayer (mld)

	- tw.ChuckieEgg2 sounds buggy (shd)
	  sounds ok to me (mld)

	- mod2ogg.sh is not posix sh compliant (bartosz taudul)
