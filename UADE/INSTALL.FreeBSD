If you get:

glib-config: not found
glib-config: not found
gtk-config: not found
gtk-config: not found

during ./configure but you know you have gtk installed, see if you have
'glib12-config' and 'gtk12-config'. If you have, then edit ./configure script
so that you replace *-config with *12-config.
