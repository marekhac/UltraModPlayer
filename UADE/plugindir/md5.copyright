The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest. This code was written by Colin
Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed. This code is in the public
domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
with every copy.
