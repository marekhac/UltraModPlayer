A very simple launch script for MorphOS UADE, made simply to keep out of
having to use CLI commands ;-)

Written by Dave Crawford.

Instructions:

Simply copy the file, and it's icon, into the UADE directory.

Drag the Icon to a panel, or make an Ambient shortcut.

Double click icon. Select module to play.

That's it. This file is freely distributable, and can be modified. Hey, it's
just a shell script :-P

Oh yeah, the author takes no responsability for the suitability or stability
of this script. Use it at your own risk.
