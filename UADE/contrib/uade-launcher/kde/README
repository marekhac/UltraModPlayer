UADE-Launcher.sh 0.11 (beebop)

DESCRIPTION:
-------------
"uade-Launcher.sh" is a unix shell script wrapper around different textmode player programs such as UADE, XMP, OGG123, ADPLUG, AYLET etc. To add more formats should be more or less trivial. 
It uses different dialog programs like kdialog, zenity, Xdialog or dialog to provide a more or less equal User interface for KDE, Gnome or console. 
The launcherscript also comes with a simple m3u playlist handling for local and remote playlist files, e.g Back 2 roots Modradio.

  o for remote file handling (http://, ftp://): a file loader:
		kfmexec, kfmclient			KDE's way get remote files
		wget					console remote file getting

  o for the music: one or more console sound player:

PROVIDES:
---------
 - open, play, stop, subsongs, sound options, openfile, playlist, modradio support
 - x-amiga.desktop file with mime infos for kde (gnome ?)
 - Back 2 Roots Channel M3u-file

INSTALLATION:
-------------
  - untar and put the script somewhere in you path.
  - for uade/ Amiga music format association to Konqueror/KDE, put the x-amiga.desktop to
    your share/mimelnk/audio/ dir in your local KDE dir. Not sure if it works too with
    Nautilus/Gnome, too, but could be worth a try.

 
USAGE:
------
 1) either drag and drop a supported file format onto the script in konqueror
 2) call the script with...
    a) a local song file as parameter
    b) a local m3u playlist as parameter
    c) a remote song URL as parameter (caches the file locally at ~/.uade/cachedmods/
       for speed up)
    d) a remote m3u URL as parameter
 3) run the script and select a file in the filerequester
 4) associate the Amiga music files to the launcher script as default application
 

HINTS'n'TIPS:
-------------
  - Wrong UI:
     To make sure you start the right dialog programm for your Desktop Environment you can edit
     DEFAULT_UI= in the script and make sure you have the kdialog, zenity or dialog
     installed. Otherwise the script uses the first working UI by the
     following order: KDE, GNOME, XDIALOG, CONSOLE
  
  - No sound with one or all players:
     The launcher script relies on the console player apps to output sound, so if the
     player works in plain console on your box, it should work with uade-launcher.sh as
     well. (see also "Doesn't play format xyz")
     If you have trouble because of using KDE's arts or Gnome's esound
     try to start the script with a dsp wrapper for your Sound daemon. Your milage may
     vary though.    
     The script was tested on a GNU/Linux with ALSA + OSS compatibility.
     
  - No sound with SPC:
     The SPC player pipes its sounddata to stdout. The script uses aplay (an alsa
     player) to output the sound. If you don't use alsa or have another platform check
     for a player that's able to play data from stdout. (something like vplay, iirc)
   
  - Doesn't find player for format xyz:
     Assumed you have the neccessary player installed, see if the console player itself
     works by calling it from an xterm or the console.
     if it works but it's not in your default $PATH, look for the INP_player section in
     the script and edit the path to your programm manually.
     
  - Purging the remote file cache:
     accessing remote files make the script to download the file into ~/.uade/cachedmods/
     If you don't like to get your $HOME littered with such file you can get rid of those
     cached files by deleting the cachedmods folder.

   piping STDERR to a file and started in bg as well... check out why.
 - dumb readline interface (??? If there's demand...)
 - output targets.
