--
{*1 -	(no issue anymore :)

{*2 -	see "Players currently in development"}

{*3 -	there's also a native unix player/xmms plugin for this format.

{*4 -	Some words about the term "MOD", since on PC it's used for all
	kind of tracker music now, it seems.
	Even if you refer to it as modfile, if it ain't a "MOD.*" or "*.MOD",
	it ain't be played.  (No, renaming ITs or XMs won't do ;)
	Since uade is emulating an Amiga, it's mainly thought to play AMIGA
	MOD file formats like Soundtracker, Noisetracker and Protracker
	and it's packed relatives. (4ch, weighted stereo, 8 bit samples).
	For completeness sake there's now a replayer based on PS3M adding
	multichannel mod support (mixing it to max 28khz in 8 or 14bit)
	S3M, XM and MTM files are also supported, but there's better
	players out there for these.	
	A really good replayer for the pc tracker formats is e.g. XMP


1.2.1 Some reasons why a certain replayer is not working: 
---------------------------------------------------------
 A bug in uade (after all uade is still experimental software;)

 A bug in the replayer or it uses a yet unsupported feature of the
 amiga delitracker(DT)/eagleplayer(EP).

 The player uses DT's noteplayer or EP2's amplifier interface. First
 steps of Eagleplayer's AMP are there, but it's still buggy.

 You try to play the wrong file with the wrong player. E.g. YM0! instead of 
 YMST files with MYST.
 Although it's both an atari st music fileformat and has even the same
 pref/ext, the fileformat is completely different. 


1.2.2 Some reasons why a certain replayer plays some mods wrong: 
----------------------------------------------------------------
 A bug in uade :)

 The replay routine might be not the newest, bug-fixed one. Many of the older
 replays didn't support all the effects/features that might be needed for
 tunes that were written for a later replay. (e.g. sfx1.3 <-> sfx1.8)
 

1.3 Players or Music formats that I couldn't test:
--------------------------------------------------
Basically anything that's not in the list of supported or unsupported
formats. E.g.

Dmdl		No mods to test with
gdm		no replayer


1.4 Players currently in development:
-------------------------------------

 Soundmon 2.0 with pseudo subsong support:
  (nothing worth to be released yet, finds far too much subsongs, atm)

  
1.5 Where to find new replayers and how to make uade use them:
--------------------------------------------------------------

To find new, not included or bugfixed replayers you have two good
points to start looking:

Exotica: http://exotica.fix.no
 On Exotica you'll find mostly replayers for delitracker but afaik you can
 also use some of them with uade, too.

Wanted team Page: http://amiga.emucamp.com/wt/wt.html 
 Don Adan/Wanted Team is still pretty busy in implementing *new* and very
 excellent replayers for all sorts of formats for the Amiga Eagleplayer.
 Most of their Eagleplayer work fine with UADE and are already included.
 If you look for new or bugfixed replayers have a look there.
 

Here's an example how to add support for a currently unsupported format:

- download (and depack if neccessary) the replayer (e.g. Amos)
- put it into the players dir $UADEDATADIR/player
- edit your $UADEDATADIR/players/uadeformats 
  (or use the xmms/beep mediaplayer  plugins formatseditor):

    Edit uadeformats as follows:

    look for the end of the formatsfule
[...]
ym	YMPlayer
zen	PTK-Prowiz
endformats
  
    ...add a new line between the last format and the endformats tag:
    The line consists of the fileextension of the format, a tab, and
    the filename of the replayer.


[...]
ym	YMPlayer
zen	PTK-Prowiz
abk	Amos
endformats

    ...now uade should be able to play ABK files.


2. Filenames and detection of the music files:
----------------------------------------------
Filenames:
 Because uade is very much an emulator and the replayers are actually
 written for the amiga, uade behaves in many aspects like the good old AMI.
 
 So, to avoid troubles it is a good idea to stick to the file naming as it
 is done on the amiga. With exceptions this means, the replayers normally
 expect a prefix instead of the three letter extensions, which are so popular
 on WIntel machines.

 E.g. TFMX song names from the Amiga: 
			    	MDAT.Turrican1-Title + SMPL.Turrican1-Title

     The combination some windows replayers use *.tfx + *.sam will not work.
     (thank god;)

Filetypedetection:
 from uade 0.40 on, started to be able to detect _some_ filetypes by it's
 contents rather then relying on the Prefix/Extension of the filename.

 Be aware it slows down adding files to the playlist of xmms (especially if
 you also enable to detect the format of crunched music files.)
 It's not anyway near of being complete, and will be updated with new
 formats slowly but surely. You can enable/disable this feature in the
 configuration of the xmms plugin. (disabled by default)

 Music formats that profit very much from this filetype detection are currently 
 TFMX and Startrekker Mod files using either Sample or AM instruments. If
 one of those formats is detected the right replayer is set automatically,
 instead of trying to play it with the default replayer set for the extension.

 Formats that can e.g. be detected by contents by the xmms plugin:
  TFMX1.5 + V7, Musicassembler, Art of Noise, AHX/THX 0, Actionamics,
  Audio Arts & Magic, Futurecomposer 1.3 + 1.4 + BSI, LegLess, Hippel +
  Hippel-Coso, Jamcracker, Soundmon 2.0 + 2.2, SoundFX, Deltamusic 1.0 + 2.0,
  SidMon1.0 +2.0, RonKlaren, MYST, Oktalyzer, Mark2, Vectordean, Fred
  Pro and Noisetracker, Startrekker MODs,  Startrekker 4am + Audiosculpture,
  Custom, etc.
 

3. Where to find the musics:
----------------------------
 The best case would be you already have them still lingering on your HD back
 from your Amiga days or rip it from your favourite demo/game all by 
 yourself.:)
 Otherwise look at:

 Exotica and UnExotica, both on: http://exotica.fix.no
  for people that look for musics, background info and so on, Exotica is
  really the best for looking for a certain song. A huge site related to
  amiga music maintained by Buzz/Iris. (info: files packed with lha)

 Wanted Team homepage: http://amiga.emucamp.com/wt/wt.html
  beside all the nice replayers of Wanted Team, you can also find
  example song files and a lot of custom.modules. 
  (A BIG thanks to Don Adan, without his eagleplayers uade wouldn't be
   able to play a lot of formats, it supports now. Great work!
   Visit his Site!)

 HAM: (Hacked Amiga Music) http://tfx.dk/ham/
  a site dedicated to "open rips", beside the songs you get infos how the
  rip was done. (info: you also sometimes need unlzx to dearchive the songs,
  the source to an unlzx can be found under "miscellaneous") 

 BAD: (Backstage of Amiga Demos) http://asle.free.fr/groups/groups.html
  a site about very old but cool Amiga Demogroups, maintained by Sylvain
  'Asle' Chipaux. 
  Asle asked me to point out that the site is currently in its early stages
  of development, but it is definetely already worth a look for all nostalgic
  people.
  If you want to rip some music yourself check out his Prowizard 4 PC, too.
  It's a nice ripping programm for amiga, unix and windows platforms and
  can be found at: http://asle.free.fr/prowiz/ (currently down :(( )

 Abyss' AHX page: http://amigascne.org/ahx/
   Home of AHX - Abyss' Highest eXperience musicformat. Among the actual editor
   (in case you like to compose yourself ahx tunes with UAE:), the links
   to Abyss Members pages (worth a look too!) you can also download a lot
   of AHX tunes as a huge lha/zip archive. 

 Rudolf Stember's Homepage: http://www.stember.com
  you can find all the music Rudolf Stember composed for Amiga games in
  the TFMX format officially on his webpage. (Das Schwarze Auge, Hanse,
  Patrizier,Mad TV, BC Kid, etc)
  Note: most files are in Windows notation. You have to change *.mdat, *.smpl 
  to the usual Amiga naming mdat.*, smpl.*  before being able to play the
  files with uade.

 Tim Wright's Homepage: http://www.coldstorage.org.uk/
  on his homepage Tim Wright hosts officially some of his game musics (such
  as Shadow of the Beast 2 and 3, Agony) as mod files and also available
  are some mp3 remixes.

 Sean 'Odie' Connolly's Cosine Website: http://www.cosine-systems.com/
  on his site you can find a lot of music Sean Connolly composed
  in many different formats, such as midi, xm or mp3. Behind the EMS Music
  link you can find Music in Sean's own format EMS_v6. 
  (the stormlord cover rules!:)

 Modland: ftp:/ftp.modland.com - very nice collection of music in all sorts of
  exotic amiga formats.

  (info: if files are packed with lzx. You can use "unlzx" for depacking
  them. The sources of an unlzx can be found both on Aminet or HAM (see above))
