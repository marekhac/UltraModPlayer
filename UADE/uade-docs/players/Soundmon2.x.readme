The soundmon players are based on the sources of the original
replay by Brian Postma <b.postma@hetnet.nl> (thanx :)

For the Soundmon Editor (sources and Amiga executable), a lot of soundmon tunes,
amiga demos, a linux/solaris soundmon player visit his homepage:
www.homepages.hetnet.nl/~brianpostma

Brian placed his m68k replay sources into the public domain. If you use his
sources in your own project, make enhancements and so on it credit him for
his ground work.
