This is a new version of the "Pierre Adane Packer" module replay for
EaglePlayer 1.54/2.00+. It's a player for all known SoundTracker
(15 samples) modules packed with Pierre Adane Packer.

Version 1

- initial release

Version 2

New features:

- added Analyzer
- added Voices
- added SampleInfo with SampleSaver (EP 2.00+ only)
- added Balance
- updated ModuleInfo
- added Volume
- added Position Counter
- added SongEnd
- added PatternJump
- added Save
- fixed recognition routine and some other bugs
- added an Amplifier version (EP 2.00+ only)

Notes:

1. This soundformat was only (?) used in some Ocean games that were written
   by French coders.

2. Default file prefixes are:

   Songdata - PAP. (for example: PAP.Pang 1)
   Samples  - SMP. (for example: SMP.Pang 1)

   You can use also "SMP.set" for the sample file name.

3. Now you can choose your preferred player version for use with EP 2.00+.

   The sound output of the Amplifier version in the Fast RAM Amplifier mode
   is sometimes very poor. I'm not sure why but perhaps it is another EP2
   bug. Sources for both player versions are available on the WT page.
