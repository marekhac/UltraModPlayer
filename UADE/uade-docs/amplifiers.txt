Here you find some infos about support of UADE using the Eagleplayer Amplifier
Interface.

What are Eagleplayer Amplifiers?:
---------------------------------
IIRC, the actual idea to use a kind of noteplayer interface to avoid direct
hardware access when replaying music on the amiga was first done by Brian Ford
for his Multiplayer on Amiga. (now GPL'd, Opensource and available on Aminet
iirc)

Other Programms like Eagleplayer, Delitracker or X-Module took up that
idea and made up their own noteplayer API implementations.

E.g. the Amplifiers of Eagleplayer made it possible to divert/mix the
audiodata  to get independent from lowlevel direct soundaccess and be
compatible for "future" soundcards or sound APIs like AHI.

On a sidenote: it would even be possible to get an emulated Amiga replayer
to use the soundhardware of the host system directly (without emulating a
virtual amiga hardware layer :) or do channel mixing outside the emulated
part... The pro is you do all mixing on the host system, the con is you
can lose platform independence this way...

There were Amplifiers for the plain 4ch Amiga Paula chips playing as if you
just "banged" normally on the hardware, Amplifiers using some nifty mixing
tricks to get even 14bit from Paula, even Amplifiers supporting 16bit
Soundcards for the Amiga.

It's all a bit like the Outputplugin idea XMMS is using. The replayer
actually doesn't need to care how to make the actual sound but produces
just the audio data, the amplifier "plugin" handles all the lowlevel sound
operations.


UADE support:
-------------
since UADE 0.80 there's some kind of a basic amplifier support (Thanks to Jan
Blumenthal for infos on their Amplifier interface). The amplifier
API handling and soundoutput is done all in score and behaves just like
using Paula, the basic Amiga soundchip (8bit, 4ch), directly.

Also we'll prefer "non amplifiered" replayers to the "amplifiered" ones,
unless the latter adds good features missing in the plain replayer.
Reason is simple, we think the plain replayers are closer to the original
replays ;)

You are of course free to exchange them with amplifier replayers you want.
