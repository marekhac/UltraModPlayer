A.1 Description
----------------
UADE is a replayer for old amiga music file formats. It uses an UAE emulation 
of the AMIGA Hardware and a cloned m68k-assembler Amiga delitracker API to
be able to replay those tunes again on platforms other than the original AMIGA.


Motivation
----------
With the cloned delitracker API you don't have to port old replay routines
from the Amiga into C or another highlevel programming language, you can
re-use the already existing Deliplayers to play those files back.

Using this Emulation approach UADE is also able to play some amount of
Delitracker-Custom modules and other music formats that come with their
replaying code in the module, too.

CPU power is not abundant these days, so uade is able to run m86k playroutines
on the amiga hardware emulation (both custom chipset and m68k emulation) in an
acceptable speed and good quality.

These amiga playroutines should mostly be bugfree(tm) and even now new
replayers are being implemented on the Amiga (or as the very first AMIGA Virus
stated it so nicely: "Something wonderful has happened, your Amiga is alive";),
so porting all these exotic replays will be an tremendous if not impossible job.
The third alternative would be to record and convert old songs into mp3's or
similar, by plugging the AMI into a stereo rack or the line-in of your
soundcard.


Technical
---------
All the external players are run in emulation with a patched UAE. The players
use an Eagleplayer/delitracker player API, which is implemented
in the sound core module (abbrev: score). The score is written in m68k
assembler. The API was reverse engineered for compability reasons from
available documentation, source and other material (for interested people:
no version of delitracker program was disassembled). The score file also
contains some replacement kickstart rom functions that are needed by
some players to function correctly.

The original Amiga(tm) kickstart rom can not be used since it's a proprietary
software and therefore copyrighted.

Uade is a patched to communicate with score indirectly. Score messages uade 
for such things as end of song and other information regarding played
songs and UADE provides score with the deliplayer, the external amiga binary
that contains the playroutine, and the module that this playroutine should
play.

You can find the sources to "score" in the amigasrc/ directory of your
uade distribution.


Compatibility:
--------------
UADE is still in its development, so not all replayers and custom-songs
will work, yet. Among the up to now supported formats are Deltamusic, Sidmon,
Hippel, Whittaker, Fredmon, MON, Soundfx, ArtOfNoise and many more,
An exact number of how many formats is a bit hard to say, and is, imho, not
really important... It's a fair amount so you will be already able to play a
good deal of the available amiga musics. ;)))

But for an incomplete list of tested, supported and unsupported replayers
(plus some more infos and also some links where one can find some music) refer
to the current uade-docs/FORMATS file.


Legal issues
------------
GPL:
Since UADE is based on UAE 0.8.9, the copyright is also GNU GPL. See the
COPYING file for further info on the GNU Public License.
All authors of original UAE can be found from directory 'docs'. Read those

The UADE sound core and UADE is placed under LGPL/GPL of course. You can find
the sources to "score" in the amigasrc/ directory of your uade distribution.

USE THIS PROGRAM ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK ! If this program destroys your data
I'm interested in finding the bug, but I'm not responsible for the damages.


Non GPL:

The external players (in 'players' directory) are copyrighted by
their respective owners (use contrib/dpi :).
Some Deliplayers are restricted.
Not all players in 'players' directory fall to copyrights of Peter
Kunath and Frank Riffel.

Note: Deliplayers by delitracker owners are not generally freely copyable,
but they are in this distribution.
I have got permission from the authors of Delitracker and the authors of
some additional deli/eagleplayers to distribute their replayers.
However their players aren't licensed under GPL!

Thanks has to go to all people who implemented players for either the Amiga
D'tracker, or Eagleplayer, and especially to Don Adan and Wanted Team
[http://amiga.emucamp.com/wt/wt.html], who are still developing new and
improved players for formats like Dave Lowe, Richard Joseph, TFMX for the
Amiga Eagleplayer, and who were so kind to let them use with uade and for
all his help. 

Tune(s):
The current uade test tune AHX.Cruisin is (c) 1997 by Manfred Linzner
alias Pink/Abyss <linzner@shinen.com>. 
It's part of 40k-intro compo for TP7 that made #2 in the competition.
For more info from Pink himself about the song read AHX.Cruisin.txt
in the songs/ahx/ folder.

Thanks a lot to Pink/Abyss for giving permission to letting us use his tune
with uade! And of course greetings to the rest of the ahx crew, too.

Installation:
--------------

    ./configure --help		shows some compile time options for uade

Please refer to the INSTALL file in the toplevel of the uade distribution for
further infos on how to compile and install UADE.


UADE is aiming to be compliant towards the lsb. (see: http://www.linuxbase.org)


B. Usage:
==========
UADE comes in several flavours. A basic console tool where you
can pass the music file, and/or the dedicated replayer and some other
options with pwrap.pl - a perl frontend for the uade console app -
and the XMMS plugin. 


All have also support for packed/archived/crunched fileformats.
(Note: some archive formats  only get depacked  if you have the neccessary
compressor/decompressor installed, e.g. lha, zip, unrar)

B.1 UADE - the console app:
---------------------------

If you don't want to use or don't need a GUI/UI like pwrap.pl or the xmms
plugin with playlists and such, or want to use it with applications
like xhippo, in scripts or with a browser plugin like plugger, you can use
uade's basic console tool "uade" for playing the amiga music.

From version 0.70 on uade is also able to play the music now without having
to mess around with the -P or -M console switches if you don't want it.
Uade now also take the filenames only and tries to figure out which replayer
to use (provided it can detect the musictype or the prefix/suffix is right)

Invoking UADE with -i switch from console enters the interactive shell mode.
 In interactive mode, you can switch to a subsong by entering the number of the
 subsong and pressing <enter>. 
 You can also switch to the next song by entering "n" and then hitting enter.

You can play one or more music files just by passing the filename to uade
like:

        uade path/filename(s) [switches]

    E.g.:
        uade cust.betrayal
    
    or
        uade customs/*
    

    Controls while playing:

        <ctrl> + <c> 		will skip to next song in the list
        <ctrl> + <alt gr> + <\>	will end playing


B.1.1	The console switches

	-P playername	the filename of the deliplayer.

			NOTE about Custom songs: CUST.* files are a bit
			special. They are basically more like players than
			like modules.
			So in order to play them you pass them with the -P
			switch to uade. Uade should know how to handle them,
			then.


	-M modulename	the filename of the module to be played with the
			deliplayer. (For custom songs use the -P switch)

	-S score	if you want to use a different score file

	-force		sometimes it's neccessary to "persuade" the
			deliplayers to play a certain song.
			To force module checks to always valid, use
			this switch and all modules are accepted and
			the deliplayer tries to play it anyway.

			(Warning! You overide the sanity checks of the replays
			 with this switch. this may crash the virtual amiga 
			 when used. Use it when you are really sure what you
			 are doing)

	-sub n		chooses subsong n

	-outpipe n	dumps the data that would be written to /dev/dsp
			to pipe n (for example n=1=stdout)

	-pipe n pid	yet non-documented pipe feature that allows to
			use uade as xmms-plugin. Uses shared
			memory mapping.. (mmap using tmp file)
			DON'T TOUCH THIS!

	-config=file	you can give uae's configuration file with this
			parameter

	-ntsc		forces amiga to have 60 Hz screen refresh rate
			(this is mostly an useless option, remember that
			Amiga code can change refresh rate by itself)

	-voltest	Override volume setting by the replayers
			(for testing purposes only)
			
	-dmawait n	tune the dmawait value
			(for testing purposes only)

	-noend		play music ad infinitum, by ignoring songend
			messages. (no need to read the src anymore, asle;)
	
	-one		play subsong and end, instead of playing
			all subsongs sequentially. Useful for recording
			one subsong at a time.

	-repeat		repeat all files at the end of the filequeue

	-pan n		panning (aka channel mixing aka stereo seperation).
			with n being any value between 0=full stereo and 
		        1=full mono.

	-t n		sets the overall playtime in seconds to play a song
			and all its subsongs.
			(useful for recording "endless" songs)

	-st n		change to next subsong after n secs of playing,
			 works like a "scan" feature to be found on cd
			 players. (useful for recording "endless songs)

	-sit n		sets the "silence timeout", the time uade waits during
			silence to decide the songs is over, to n secs.

	-d		enter UAE debugger. Useful for ...er... well
			debugging and maybe for doing memory dumps for
			finding converted/unpacked music in the virtual
			amiga memory.

	-sh		enable speedhack (run the replayer with 1 instruction
			per second)

	-no-sh		disable speedhack (even if the replayer tries to use
			it)

	-f		toggle lowpass filter

	-i		interactive command line shell: 
			e.g.:

			h + <enter>	-> help	
			n + <enter>	-> next song
			1 + <enter>	-> jump to subsong 1
			5 + <enter>	-> jump to subsong 5
			etc.


 Examples:	uade -P players/ArtOfNoise -M music/AON.big_deal

		   would play the musicfile AON.big_deal in music/ with the
		   the ArtOfNoise replayer binary on players/

		uade -P players/ArtOfNoise -M music/AON.big_deal -force

		   would play the musicfile AON.big_deal in music/ with the
		   the ArtOfNoise replayer binary in players/, even if the
		   player would reject the file as a valid music file for it.

		uade -P CUST.MyFavouriteCustomSong

		   would cause uade to play the custom tune that was
		   passed to score with the -P switch

		uade -P CUST.MyFavouriteCustomSong -sub 2

		   would cause uade to play the 2nd subsong of the 
		   custom tune that was passed to score with the -P switch

	
		uade -P CUST.MyFavouriteCustomSong -ntsc

		   would cause uade to play the music in NTSC speed
		   (only if the player or in this case the Custom song
		    supports it;) 


Note: When you run uade, 'uaerc' and 'score' files must exist in current
directory or in ~/.xmms/uade ! If needed, the files 'uaerc' and 'score'
can be obtained from the main dir of this software distribution.



B.1.2	Redirecting the output:
--------------------------------
The console tool also provides the possibility to redirect the UAE audio
output to either save it to disk for further use, like converting it
to a wavefile or encoding it as mp3 or ogg, or to pipe the output directly
to other applications, that can read their input from stdin/stdout.

E.g. dumping audio stream to stdout and converting it to wav and ogg vorbis
formats:

	./uade -P players/FC1.3 -M songs/future_composer/fc13.smod7 -outpipe 1 >./music.raw
	sox -t raw -r 44100 -c 2 -s -w ./music.raw ./music.wav
	oggenc music.wav

on AmigaOS/MorphOS you might want to do:

	./uade -P players/FC1.3 -M songs/future_composer/fc13.smod7 -outpipe 1 > "AUDIO:B=16 F=44100 C=2"

Another example:

	for i in `seq 1 3` ; do uade songfile -pan 1 -one -sub $i -outpipe 1 > sub.$i.raw ; sox -t raw -r 44100 -c 2 -s -w sub.$i.raw sub.$i.wav ; rm sub.$i.raw ; done
	will record subsongs 1-3 into separate wav files, with panning = 1
	(mono). You may want to make a shell script out of this.

B.2 UADE XMMS input plugin
==========================
For people that prefer a GUI rather than plain console apps and their
switches or those who just want to listen to their music with XMMS and take
advantage of it's features like playlists, different output, effect and
visual plugins ("disco tux" rocks!;) there's also a UADE XMMS input plugin.

All the options of the console app can be configured by a more user friendly
graphical interface, songend, subsongs or ntsc speed can now switched on the
fly, music files are detected by their file prefix or extension.

From UADE 0.40 the xmms plugin comes also with a filetype detection for some
few formats, now. (It slows down loading a huge playlist, though:)


B.2.1 Changing Subsongs
------------------------
To change subsongs in the XMMS plugin, just click on the area
where you would normally seek into an mp3. A small popup
window should appear.
With the arrow buttons you can go to the previous or next subsong, with
the slider you select the subsong number you want to listen to directly.

If you think the music file is playing too slow it might be that the 
music was originally written for an NTSC Amiga and the replayer uses a 
Vertical Blank timed replay.

For changing the play speed from PAL to NTSC just enable the "ntsc" toggle
and wait a short while, it should play faster if the ntsc toggle is on, then.

To get rid of the subsong changer popup just focus/activate a different
window.

Note:	The subsong changer is configurable by UADE Configure. People
	that don't like the default position of the arrow buttons on top and
	bottom of the slider can choose a different setup.
	People with remote controls can disable the popup for a different
	more compatible method, too. 
	(see below, "Configuring the plugin")


B.2.2 Fileinfo
---------------
UADE also supports in a simple way the XMMS fileinfo.
Currently the played filename or when the replayer supports it the real name of
the song, some fancy comment ;), the format name of the responsible replayer,
and the number of minimal, maximal and currently played subsong is displayed,
so far.


B.2.3 Configuring the plugin
-----------------------------

To configure the plugin, open the XMMS preferences and look for the uade plugin
in the list of available plugins. If you select UADE in that list and click on
configure you'll get a configuration Window, where you can set and alter
several uade options.
The configuration window is divided in several "pages":


B.2.3.1	Options

B.2.3.1-2	PAL/NTSC timing

	[ ] use NTSC[60hz]	- for replayers with Vertical Blank Interrupt
				  timing and modules that play a bit slow
				  now.
B.2.3.1-3	Panning (%)

	[ ] enable [-{}-------]	- mixes the x% of the left channel to the
				  right and x% of the right to the left
				  channel. (e.g. for better listening with
				  headphones).
B.2.3.1-4	Volume (%)

	[ ] enable [-{}-------]	- adjusts the volume level of the sound
				  of the uade plugin.


B.2.3.1-5	Timeout & Songend

Most Amiga replays do not support playing time. So uade does not know
how long a certain music is.
Some replayers however signal if the song is over and uade honours this
feature if the player supports it.
Unfortunately not all Amiga replayers support songend and on the Amiga the
music is played in an infinite loop until the user switched the songs manually.
With the following options you can change this timeout and songend behaviour.

	Timeout: (min/sec)	- Here you can enter the playtime when uade
				  should end the current song and change to the
				  next one in the playlist

	[ ] timeout for endless modules 

				- to enable the timeout value for infinite
				  modules activate this option.
				  NOTE: UADE will also end a song that is
					plays longer than the timeout for
					replayers that support songend

	[ ] songend enabled	- useful if you have music files with
				  very short subsongs and replayers that
				  support songend to switch through all
				  subsongs with the subsong changer.


	[ ] play subsongs in sequence
	
				- on songend or timeout go to the next
				  subsong rather instead to the next file.
				  (This option is only working if songend
				   and/or timeout is enabled !)


	Timeout after silence (sec) 
				- enter the time in seconds uade should
				  interpret a period of silence as songend.
				   

B.2.3.1-6	Compatibility options

	[ ] detect some files by contents...

				- normally UADE relies on the right Prefix
				  or Extension of in the filename of the
				  music file to choose the right replay.
				  With this option uade tries to detect
				  files by it's contents and chooses
				  the right player, then. 
				  Very handy if the prefix/extension is
				  wrong to detect the right format
				  Works only for some formats, yet.

	[ ] decrunch packed files before filecheck

				- If you also want uade to analyze crunched
				  files for its contents to choose the right
				  player, enable this option.

	Note: both of above 2 options can slow down the loading and processing
	      of the xmms playlist a lot.

	[ ] force deliplayers to play tunes

				- always try to play a file with a replayer,
				  even if it refuses to play. This option
				  makes it e.g. also possible to play some
				  formats with wrong replayers:
				  SM1 with SM2, INS with SYN replayer.


	Note:all these options are off by default


B.2.3.2	GUI

B.2.3.2-1	configuration of the subsong changer

	[ ] arrows on left and right	-put prev/next subsong buttons on left
					 and right end of the changer
					 
	[ ] arrows on top and bottom	- put the prev/next subsong buttons
					  on top and bottom of the changer.
					  (handy for people with a WM with
					   autofocus policy)

	Note: You could also create a subsong changer with no arrows buttons
	      or - if someone really wants;- with arrow buttons on left, right,
	      top, bottom. (It's not a bug... it's feature ;)


	[ ] disable uade's subsong changer...

					- for people with remote controls.
					  the subsong is changed by the xmms 
					  seek slider bar. 
					  next subsong = movement in positive
					  direction
					  previous subsong = movement in
					  negative direction.
					  (suggested by Mikael Bouillot)


B.2.3.3 System

B.2.3.3-1	Systempaths

	(obsolete)

B.2.3.3-2	optimized filescaning for the playlist

	[ ] optimize Filescanning	- enables a cache to speed up the
					  filescanning for the playlist.

	optional filetype creation:
	
	if you compiled the xmms plugin with mimetype generation for
	Konqueror or rox filemanager a button to create the mimetype for
	those filemanagers appears here.

B.2.3.3-3	uadeformats file

Unlike the Amiga Delitracker who "talked" to its deliplayers directly about
who plays what, uade uses a kind of workaround and tries to detect the files
by their file prefix or file extension.

The reason are among other things speed related, because of the way XMMS
builds up it's playlist and the speed of the emulation.

The information about which prefix/extension belongs to what player is stored
in a file called uadeformats in the deliplayers/ directory.

The xmms plugin _relies_ on the infos in this file (even if you enable
"detect file by contents") and so it is a good idea to stick to the correct
prefixes and extensions of the music formats both in the uadeformats file but
also with naming the music files themselves.
E.g. A Hippel(HIP) and a Hippel-coso(HIPC) are not the same format and
therefore have both different prefixes and use different replayers. So,
renaming all his Amiga music files to *.mod is a very bad idea ;))) 

Btw.  beside a list of supported/unsupported replayers, you can also
find the default prefixes in the brackets behind the working Musicformats
in the "uade-docs/formats.txt" file.


The editor:
if you click on "edit uadeformats file..." you'll get a simple editor for
this database. You get a list with already known pref/suffix and player
combinations, and can add new ones, edit or erase existing ones. The drop
down box contains the list of the available players in your "players dir:"
path. 
If you press "ok" or "apply" all modifications are saved,
if you press cancel you exit the editor without saving the changes.


B.2.4 the About requester ;)
----------------------------

Among the Credits (read it, those are people who helped us a lot and deserve
it to be credited) and the GPL there a little page with some hints and tips
as well.


B.2.5 the playtime database
---------------------------

One big problem of the deli and eagleplayer on the amiga is there's no real
possibility of detecting the duration of the music. Eagleplayer addressed 
this in a kind of way but unfortunately only for the first subsong and only
for some formats.

From uade-0.51 on there's now a workaround for this lack of feature. Uade
"learns" and "remembers" the duration of a music file when it was played to 
the end. So, when you next time load this music, uade gets the information
from a database in the .xmms/uade user directory to display the playtime
of the file.  Files will be determined by it's contents and also for fast
playlist display by the name. If you play a renamed file it will still be
recognized by the database by it's contents and a new entry in name database
will be put. The more files you play the larger your database will grow.

Note: this features is only available for replayers that support songend and
only files that played through without interruption will be put into the
database. If you play the subsongs sequentially the duration of the overall
playtime of all subsongs together is stored.


Merging two databases can be done easily with "cat":

    cat newdatabase >> olddatabase

...will add the new database to the old one.


B.3 other "frontends"
---------------------

There's an alternative frontend  for users who can't or don't want to
use xmms, and find the plain uade executable far too spartanic.


B.3.1 pwrap.pl perl frontend 
----------------------------

A userfriendly perl frontend by Meleth with playlists, randomplay,
subsong skipping, etc.

Usage:	pwrap.pl --help		for help on all options
	pwrap.pl		start as console app
	pwrap.pl --tk		start as perl/tk app

Use the numberkeypad (with NumLock on) to control ffd, skip etc,
while running in console mode.


C. Hints and Tips
=================

   Do some deliplayers refuse to play the
    modules? Try enabling 'force deliplayer
    to play the tunes you chose'

    For a very nice pseudo surround effect get
    David Le Corfec's FX Toolbox plugin from
    the effects plugins page on the xmms
    homepage.

    For a ported AHX and TFMX player get
    David Le Corfec's plugins from the
    input plugins page on the xmms
    homepage.

    For playing a lot of Protracker clones get
    yourself XMP from http://xmp.sf.net
    BTW. XMP has also an experimental xmms plugin.
    
    A Futurecomposer reference player for unix
    by Michael Schwendt is available on the
    xmms input plugins page

    For ripping Amiga music yourself on a PC class
    machine get yourself prowiz for pc by Sylvain 'Asle'
    Chipaux

    For live streaming your amiga tunes get
    the LiveIce plugin from the xmms homepage
    
    For heaps of Amiga tunes and nostalgia visit
    the Exotica Webpage at: http://exotica.fix.no
