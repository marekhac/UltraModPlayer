.SH "NAME"
UADE \- the Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.TP 
.B uade
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIfile\fR
.TP 

.B uade
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI\-P Playerfile\fR \fI\-M Musicfile\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
It uses code from UAE Amiga Emulator to emulate Amiga hardware. In
addition the original Deliplayer and Eagleplayer APIs have been
re\-implemented with m68k\-assembler to re\-use existing player plugins by
emulation.

\fBcommandline options:\fR

.TP 
\fB\-P, \-pl\fR playerfile
the filename of the eagleplayer.
NOTE about Custom songs: CUST.* files are a bit
special. They are basically more like players than
like modules.

So in order to play them you pass them with the \-P
switch to uade. Uade should know how to handle them,
then.

.TP 
\fB\-M, \-mod\fR modulefile
the filename of the module to be played with the
eagleplayer. (For custom songs use the \-P switch)

.TP 
\fB\-S,	\-score\fR scorefile
if you want to use a different score file

.TP 
\fB\-f,	\-force\fR
sometimes it's neccessary to "persuade" the
eagleplayers to play a certain song.
To force module checks to always valid, use
this switch and all modules are accepted and
the eagleplayer tries to play it anyway.
(Warning! You overide the sanity checks of the replays
with this switch. this may crash the virtual amiga 
when used. Use it when you are really sure what you
are doing)

.TP 
\fB\-s, \-sub\fR n		
chooses subsong n

.TP 
\fB\-outpipe\fR n
dumps the data that would be written to /dev/dsp
to pipe n (for example n=1=stdout)

.TP 
\fB\-pipe\fR n pid
yet non\-documented pipe feature that allows to
use uade as xmms\-plugin. Uses shared
memory mapping.. (mmap using tmp file)
DON'T TOUCH THIS!

.TP 
\fB\-config\fR=file
you can give uae's configuration file with this
parameter

.TP 
\fB\-ntsc\fR
forces amiga to have 60 Hz screen refresh rate
(this is mostly an useless option, remember that
Amiga code can change refresh rate by itself)

.TP 
\fB\-voltest\fR
Override volume setting by the replayers
(for testing purposes only)

.TP 
\fB\-dmawait\fR n
tune the dmawait value
(for testing purposes only)

.TP 
\fB\-ne, \-no\-end\fR
play music ad infinitum, by ignoring songend
messages. (no need to read the src anymore, asle;)

.TP 
\fB\-one\fR
play subsong and end, instead of playing
all subsongs sequentially. Useful for recording
one subsong at a time.

.TP 
\fB\-rp, \-repeat\fR
repeat all files at the end of the filequeue

.TP 
\fB\-p, \-pan\fR n
panning (aka channel mixing aka stereo seperation).
with n being any value between 0=full stereo and 
1=full mono.

.TP 
\fB\-t\fR n
sets the overall playtime in seconds to play a song
and all its subsongs.
(useful for recording "endless" songs)

.TP 
\fB\-st\fR n
works like a "scan" feature to be found on cd
players. Switch to next subsong after 'n' seconds of playing
(useful for recording "endless songs)

.TP 
\fB\-sit\fR n
sets the "silence timeout", the time uade waits during
silence to decide the songs is over, to n secs.

.TP 
\fB\-r, \-rand\fR
Play songs in random order

.TP 
\fB\-d\fR
enter UAE debugger. Useful for ...er... well
debugging and maybe for doing memory dumps for
finding converted/unpacked music in the virtual
amiga memory.
.TP 
\fB\-sh\fR
enable speedhack. Emulate all instructions to be executed
in one m68k cycle. Some players, such as EMS v6, take too
many m68k cycles to be real\-time. This option gives them
enough m68k cycles. Notice that you do _not_ need to use this
switch with EMS v6 or Octamed, because it is automatically enabled for
that format. The replayer knows to ask for speedhack.
.TP 
\fB\-no\-sh\fR
disable speedhack (even if the replayer tries to use
it)
.TP 
\fB\-fi, \-filter\fR
toggle lowpass filter
.TP 
\fB\-swap\-bytes\fR
Swaps output sample bytes (use only with 16\-bit samples), ie
changes the endianess of the output samples. By default UADE
outputs native endian samples.
.TP 
\fB\-i\fR
interactive command line shell: 
e.g.:
.br 
			h + <enter>	\-> help
.br 
			n + <enter>	\-> next song
.br 
			1 + <enter>	\-> jump to subsong 1
.br 
			5 + <enter>	\-> jump to subsong 5
.br 
			etc.
.SH "SUPPORTED FORMATS"
Many... among them are e.g. CUST, MOD, MED, TFMX, DW, HIPPEL, VECTORDEAN...

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP 
\fBuade \-P players/ArtOfNoise \-M music/AON.big_deal\fR
.br 
plays the musicfile AON.big_deal in music/ with the the ArtOfNoise replayer binary on players/
.TP 
\fBuade \-P players/ArtOfNoise \-M music/AON.big_deal \-force\fR
.br 
plays the musicfile AON.big_deal in music/ with the
the ArtOfNoise replayer binary in players/, even if the
player would reject the file as a valid music file for it.
.TP 
\fBuade \-P CUST.MyFavouriteCustomSong\fR
.br 
causes uade to play the custom tune that was
passed to score with the \-P switch
.TP 
\fBuade \-P CUST.MyFavouriteCustomSong \-sub 2\fR
.br 
causes uade to play the 2nd subsong of the 
custom tune that was passed to score with the \-P switch
.TP 
\fBuade \-P CUST.MyFavouriteCustomSong \-ntsc\fR
.br 
causes uade to play the music in NTSC speed
(only if the player or in this case the Custom song
supports it;) 
.LP 
\fB>Redirecting the output:\fR
.br 
The console tool also provides the possibility to redirect the UAE audio
output to either save it to disk for further use, like converting it
to a wavefile or encoding it as mp3 or ogg, or to pipe the it directly
to other applications, that can read their input from stdin/stdout.
.br 
E.g. dumping audio stream to stdout and converting it to wav and ogg vorbis
formats:
.IP 
\fBuade \-P players/FC1.3 \-M songs/future_composer/fc13.smod7 \-outpipe 1 >./music.raw
sox \-t raw \-r 44100 \-c 2 \-s \-w ./music.raw ./music.wav
oggenc music.wav\fR
.LP 
on \fBAmigaOS/MorphOS\fR you might want to do:
.IP 
\fBuade \-P players/FC1.3 \-M songs/future_composer/fc13.smod7\-outpipe 1 > "AUDIO:B=16 F=44100 C=2"\fR
.LP 
Another example:
.IP 
\fBfor i in `seq 1 3` ; do uade songfile \-pan 1 \-one \-sub $i \-outpipe 1 > sub.$i.raw ; sox \-t raw \-r 44100 \-c 2 \-s \-w sub.$i.raw sub.$i.wav ; rm sub.$i.raw ; done\fR
.LP 
will record subsongs 1\-3 into separate wav files, with panning = 1
(mono). You may want to make a shell script out of this
