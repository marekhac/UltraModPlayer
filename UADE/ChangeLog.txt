CHANGE LOG
----------

Date format is YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601 time specification).

2005-07-23:    uade 1.03
	- AmigaOS4 fixes from Nicolas A. Mendoza
	- Significant bug fixes in file format detection and sound core setup
	- mod2ogg.sh improvements frmo Giulio Canevari
	- CoreAudio fixes from Stuart Caie
	- Mac OS X configuratio fixes from Stuart Caie and Michael Baltaks

2005-07-15:     no release
	- Found a possible bug that may have haunted UADE 1.x users. With
	  some formats songs would play differently on some runs, and the
	  possible problem is uade_prerun/uade_reset. We do:
		   1. clear state
		   2. load next song
		   3. if failure, go to number 2
	  Number 3 is a problematic because number 2 changes state.
	  So number 3 should jump to number 1. duh.. (shd)

2005-07-12:     no release
	- A big bug fix in amifilemagic. chk_id_offset() used sizeof(char *)
	  as a comparison size (in bytes) to match certain patterns from
	  modules. On x86 the size was always 4, which is the right size
	  for most of the time.. On amd64 the size is 8, which is almost
	  always the wrong size. Now it's fixed with strlen(patterns[i]).
	  (shd)

2005-06-26:     no release
	- merged mod2ogg.sh changes from Giulio Canevari
	  <giuliogiuseppecarlo (/AT\) interfree.it>. See the script in

	  <thomas@winischhofer.net> for publishing the source code under
	  BSD license. See amigasrc/players/music_maker/ChangeLog (shd)
	- Fixed Sonix Driver Problem. Now the initialization order for
	  eagleplayers is following:
		       1. Call DTP_Config
		       2. Call DTP_Check2 / EP_Check5 / EP_Check3 (in this
		          order of importance)
		       3. Call DTP_ExtLoad
          (shd)

2005-03-18:     no release
	- added ascii dumping to uade debugger. 'm' command prints ascii
	  letters of memory next to hexadecimal numbers. (shd)

2005-03-17:	no release
	- lots of fixes to score to make MusicMaker8 player work. the new
	  score is 'amigasrc/score/score_48'.
	  - DTP_Config() and DTP_ExtLoad() must be called before DTP_Check2()
          - Check() assumes that dtg_PathArrayPtr(a5) contains full
            module name path. UADE didn't provide this. Other players I've
            seen do not assume this (we have 80+ players).
          - Now Config() and ExtLoad() are called before Check(). This broke
	    Sonix Music Driver player. We are working on a fix.
          - dos.library/Lock() returned success always, even if the file
            provided didn't exist. This was _designed_ to work so, but
            with MusicMaker8 it causes a failure. I fixed this. Now the
            Lock() returns success if and only if the file exists.
            I'm afraid this change will break some players, but we shall
            see..
          - dos.library/Read() returned wrong value, but had the right side
            effect. This was not fixed in score, but in src/uade.c.
          - Added EPG_NewLoadFile(), alias to DTG_NewLoadFile()
          - Added new debugging check points for UADE debugger
	  - Renamed functions in score.
	  - Added exec.library/SuperState() and exec.library/UserState()
	    functions
	  (shd)

2005-03-07:      uade 1.01
	- Jochen Hippel and Jeroen Tel (aka mon_old) player from Don Adan /
	  Wanted Team
	- Amos Music Bank converter from Eagleplayer guys
	- NetBSD compatibility fix

	  that was for FreeBSD that doesn't have ftw) (shd)
	  
2005-02-11:      no release
	- hopefully fixed a configure bug on macosx (couldn't find 'make')
	  (shd)

	 (giulio canevari)


2005-01-08:      no release
	- fixed a potential segfault bug in uade.c / uade_calc_reloc_size().
	  the bug could have been used to crash uade, but not to exploit
	  further. (shd)

2004-12-20:      no release
	- mod2ogg.sh update. Should work ok with fade on multiple files/subsongs
	 (giulio canevari)

2004-12-01:      no release
	- put new  Eagleplayers by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	  into players dir: JeroenTel aka Mon_old (mld)

2004-11-15:      no release
	- posix compliancy fix for mod2ogg.sh. thanks to Bartosz Taudul
          for reporting the problem. (giulio canevari)

2004-11-09:      no release
	- added a feature into relocator in score. now it can handle some
	  new debug hunks, the 0x03f1 hunk.. (shd)

2004-10-30:      uade 1.00
	- it's stable now. a new development branch will be started soon.
	  development branch will contain some new features not found in
	  1.00, but it will not contain some irrelevant features found
	  from 1.00. the stable branch will have occasional updates
	  containing only bug fixes and critical missing features.

2004-09-27:      uade 1.00_pre1
	- libao support
	- mod2ogg script from Giulio Canevari in frontends/mod2ogg

	- a bug fix of the bug fix of yesterday. my bad. thanks to
	  Michal Januszewski for doing the second fix (shd)
	- added mod2ogg script from Giulio Canevari into frontends/mod2ogg.
	  The script can be used to convert songs to wav/ogg/mp3 formats.
	  See the script file for more information. (shd)

2004-09-09:      no release
	- fixed a bug in beep media player plugin. using file selector
	  would give the plugin files in URL format (file://). We
	  didn't handle URLs in XMMS plugin, from which the beep
	  code is derived. thanks to will@johnstonclan.net for
	  reporting the bug. (shd)

2004-08-31:      no release
	- fixed eagleplayer queries (shd)

2004-08-29:      no release
	- added a mechanism to query information from inside eagleplayers.
	  the eagleplayer can query facts from uade, by following means:
	       	move.l	4.w,a6
		lea	uadename(pc),a1
		moveq	#0,d0
		jsr	_LVOOpenLibrary(a6)
		move.l	d0,uadebase
		tst.l	d0
		beq	not_running_under_uade
		move.l	d0,a6
		lea	query(pc),a0		* query
		lea	response(pc),a1		* response area
		moveq	#12,d0			* maximum response length
		jsr	-18(16)
		* returns how much the full response would take (can be
		* more than the given maximum response length which
		* indicates an error and thus the response is invalid).
		* in case of unknown query, the function returns a negative
		* value
		tst.l	d0
		bmi.b	unknown_attribute
		cmp.l   #12,d0
		bhi.b   we_should_have_had_more_space_for_response
		cmp.b	response(pc),a0
		cmp.b	#'Y',(a0)
		beq	use_vblank
		* the answer is No. Don't use vblank timing.

	  uadebase	dc.l	0
	  uadename	dc.b	'uade.library',0
	  query		dc.b	'VBLANK',0
	  response	dc.b	12,0	* space for 'Yes',0 or 'No',0

	  The system call returns a negative value for all invalid queries.
	  For valid queries the system call returns how much space the
	  response would have taken. If the system call returns a value
	  that is higher than that which was given as the maximum length
	  then the response is invalid. The system call should be
	  restarted with a higher maximum length value (at least as much
	  as the last system call returned).
 

2004-08-23:	no release
	- PTK-Prowiz: added Blacklist for the Protracker mods that *need* vblank
	  timing. e.g. mod.face another day by Jogeir Liljedahl and others
	  If you encounter one of those, just report them to me (mld)

2004-08-10:	no release
	- gnome and kde launcher script updates (mld)

2004-08-02:      no release

	- ALSA fixes
	- Beep Media Player plugin
	- Configure and build fixes

	- SDL fix

2004-07-27:      no release
	- added --without-[alsa|oss|alsa] into configure script (shd)

2004-07-16:      uade 0.91-pre3
	- configuration script fixes. make bmp plugin global installable,
	  it was only 'user' installable on 0.91-pre2
	- remove unnecessary #include dependencies from bmp plugin. this
	  makes 0.91-pre3 compilable on some systems
	- add GUI preferences into BMP plugin (experimental code)

2004-07-16:      no release
	- bmp plugin configure fix. The input plugin was installed into
	  `pkg-config bmp --variable=plugin_dir` rather than 
	  `pkg-config bmp --variable=input_plugin_dir` (Goetz Waschk)
	- remove unnecessary #include <bmp/configfile.h> from
	  plugindir/beepmp/{uade.c,subsongseek.c} (Goetz Waschk)

2004-07-15:      no release
	- fixed "--xmms-plugin-dir" override (mld)
	- added config and GUI stuff to bmp plugin (mld)

2004-07-15:      uade 0.91-pre2
	- fixed a fatal ALSA bug
	- lots of configuration fixes, such as make bmp plugin compilable
	  on most systems
	- up-to-dates for MOS
	
2004-07-15:      no release
	- added -B switch to set base directory of uade's data files. base
	  directory contains all the files that are needed to use uade
	  (files such as uaerc, score, and the directory named 'players'
	  that contains all the eagleplayers) (shd)
	- fixed 'make test' with -B (shd)
	- mos up-to-dates (piru)
	- configure script fix: ALSA and strl* tests now obey CC environment
	  variable (shd)
	- both the xmms and bmp plugin share the same db content file
	  (~/.uade/db-content) (shd)

2004-07-14:      no release
	- more configure script tweaking.. (shd)
	- yet another ALSA fix. If user pressed CTRL-C for command line tool
	  the ALSA back-end would quit uade because write returned an
	  error condition (EINTR). How did I miss this one originally?! How
	  many iterations does it take to get ALSA right??? (shd)

2004-07-12:      no release
	- newer versions of bmp use bmp.pc for pkg-config rather than beep.pc.
	  we will only be supporting newer versions of bmp, and pkg-config
	  must be used, unless some special configure switches are given (shd)
	- fixed a bug in configure script that made bmp plugin uncompilable.
	  changed the script to use pkg-config bmp --variable=plugin_dir
	  to get the plugin dir. newer versions of bmp do not have
	  beep-config command. (shd)

2004-07-10:      uade 0.91-pre1
	- a devel release with lots of changes. see entries till uade 0.90
	  (shd)

2004-07-10:      no release
	- configure changes (shd)
	- fixed beepmp plugin compilation problem (shd)
	- from now on uade specific files go to the global data dir or
	  ~/.uade. player (xmms or beep media player) specific files go to
	  global player dirs or player dir at $HOME (~/.xmms or ~/.bmp) (shd)
	- enabled auto db saves for player plugins. ie. automatic save
	  of play times that are known from experience. a reminder here:
	  for many formats that uade supports the only way to know the
	  play length is to play it from beginning to the end. and even worse
	  is that for some formats we don't even know when the song has 
	  ended. (shd)
	- code cleanups in xmms plugin (shd)
	- PATH_MAX => UADE_PATH_MAX (1024). Not exactly UNIX compliant
	  but it will do for now. Anyone have directory hierarchies
	  with over 1k length?? (shd)

2004-07-07:      no release
	- amifilemagic: added magicid detection for polkapacker, kris, skyt and
	 ice tracker (mld)

	- added module name parsing to MED/OctaMED (mld) 
	  Soundmon2.2 (mld)

2004-07-04:      no release
	- force playing by default should not be the default in xmms plugin.
	  we'd better work on better filemagic heuristics. (shd)

2004-07-03:      no release
	- fixed sdl sound target to support mono and 8 bit sounds (shd)
	- fixed unsqsh for 64 bit platforms (shd)

	  Soundmon2.2 (mld)

2004-07-01:      no release
	- added beep plugin config, make, install (shd/mld)
	- fixed a module name bug in sound core. breaks a few of our
	  eagleplayers but they'll be fixed shortly.. (shd)

2004-06-30:      no release
	- beep input plugin commited (mld)

2004-06-19:      no release
	- fixed a crash bug on morphos that happens when ahi.device open fails
	  (piru)
	- playlist is now non-recursive by default. you must give -R from
	  command line if you want to add directories recursively.
	  uade /my/dir will do nothing but uade -R /my/dir will act as it
	  used to be. (shd)
	- added NULL sound output which outputs nothing on all architectures
	  (shd)
	- removed irrelevant dependencies from sd-sound-ahi.h (shd)
	- configure obeys CC, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables. Try:
	    CC="gcc-3.4.0" CFLAGS="-O3" ./configure
	  (shd)

2004-06-18:      no release
	- fixed the known ALSA signal bug. see src/sd-sound-alsa.h, added
	  the function alsa_xrun_recovery() to handle signal and error
	  situations (shd)
	- improved configure to add sound target source dependencies into
	  src/Makefile (shd)
	- fixed command line parameter handling for xmms slave. the new
	  command line parameter handler dropped map file name given for
	  --xmms-slave even if it is needed in the xmms slave setup. (shd)
	- ALSA auto detection to configure script (shd)

2004-06-15:      no release
	- command line parameter improvement. parameters that are handled
	  in uade.c are not passed for slaves. (piru)

2004-06-15:      uade 0.90 prison torment

	    Driver from Don Adan / Wanted Team
	- updated players:
	  - CustomMade (aka RonKlaren) from Don Adan / Wanted Team

	  player) and Beam (Thomas Hermann Player)
	- improved tfmx detection
	- code restructuring
	- lots of bug fixes
	- openbsd fixes with support from Ave
	- macosx fixes from Stuart Caie aka Kyzer
	- launcher scripts for KDE (req. kdialog) and Gnome (req. gdialog)
	  into contrib/uade-launcher

	  use --user to install to user's home directory.
	- man page
	- panning crash bug fix from Piru
	- installation file permission bug fix from Markus
	- many other changes. See previous entries back from uade 0.81
	- probably the longest stable release changelog (shd)

2004-06-13:      no release
	- added Sonix Music Driver from Don Adan (shd)

2004-05-03:	uade 0.90-pre3-grue
	- fixed date in changelog.txt *g* (mld)
	- put new  Eagleplayer(s) by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	  into players dir: Cinemaware (mld)
	- on popular demand, added plaintext fullpath to xmms modinfo
	  additionally to hovering over "?" button (mld)
	- modded the modinfo text a bit (shd)
	- fixed a fatal bug in DTP_Load_File in score. I didn't have motivation
	  to do loading properly in the first place. It would have taken
	  me 5 minutes to do it, and now it took me 2 hours to locate the
	  bug with Cinemaware player. In the future this bug will be
	  automatically detected. This fixed at least the following songs:
	    - Wings (various) (Cineware player)
	    - Beam (Thomas Hermann player)
	  (shd)

2004-04-15:      uade 0.90-pre2
	- modifications since 0.90-pre1:
	  - fixed a fatal bug with ALSA support
	  - better FHS compliancy (man page to the right place)
	  - fixed panning for MOS

2004-04-14:      no release
	- a major bug fix for ALSA support. It crashed on most machines on
          from the command line, but didn't affect xmms. sd-sound-alsa.c:
           snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near (..., ..., rate, 0) =>
           snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near (..., ..., &rate, 0)
	  For some reason compiler didn't catch this error on my other
	  machine, but fortunately the other did :-) (shd)

	- modifications since 0.81:
	  - code rafactoring

        - finally, we have native alsa support. Use --with-alsa for
	  configure script. (shd)
	- -dev / -device switch controls sound device for ALSA and OSS. For OSS
	  it is a sound device file, such ass /dev/dsp1. For ALSA it is ALSA

	  from configure system page. the time interval can be edited from
	  xmms config file. i have following:
		 auto_db_saves=TRUE
		 auto_db_save_interval=3600
	  this enables auto saving every hour. note that auto saving can
	  only take place if you start playing some file with uade. The db
	  is of course still saved every time you quit xmms. (shd)

2003-09-15:      no release
	- auto save song databases every day in xmms plugin. it's annoying
	  to lose days of song content hashes due to an xmms crash! (shd)

	- indenting few of the xmms plugin modules (shd)

2003-09-08:      no release
	- broke command line options. more breakage coming. (shd)
	- added --rand/-r which randomizes order of songs given for uade.
	  Before you tell me it doesn't work, consider this: it only
	  randomizes entries given from the command line. So if you give only
	  a directory name as an argument, it won't randomize the order of
	  files under that directory. (shd)
	- new song queuing system. things are broken again. fixing soon. (shd)
	- fixed an annoying command line tool bug: if the player for a given
	  song was not found, uade exited even if there was songs in queue
	  (shd)

2003-09-07:      no release
	- xmms plugin can now handle more error situations properly. cases:

	  configuration():
	      char timeoutstr[32];
	      strlcpy(timeoutstr, timeout_val, strlen(timeoutstr));
	  Dumb bug, isn't it? (shd)
	- added --debug swith to configure script. enables debugging support.
	  (shd)
	- Valgrind found more bugs from decrunch code. Filemagic detection
	  assumed (wrong) that enough bytes were read from the file to
	  detect magic values. (shd)

2003-07-07:      no release
	- tried Valgrind ( http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj ) with uade, fixed
	  2 memory leaks, and 1 use of uninitialized chipmemory! (shd)

	  never happened afaik). one bug displaying improper song duration
	  on xmms playlist (thanks to Grue for pointing out the problem).
	  (shd)

	  contact us so that we can investigate behaviour of our filter.
	  (shd)

2003-05-22:     no release

	  invalid documents is lame. (shd)

2003-05-15:      uade 0.80-pre6
	- fixed a big song end bug that affected the xmms plugin. only one
	  subsong per song could have natural song end. this did not
	  affect command line tool. (shd)

2003-04-20:      no release
	- ciab int in intena is enabled by default for some dirty custom
	  songs like Plague custom version to work. it doesn't let score
	  know of using ciab interrupt in anyway, it just hits $78
	  (ciab int vector) and hopes that interrupts will happen. those
	  interrupts didn't happen because we had them disabled (shd)

2003-04-19:      no release
	- removed hunk 0x3f7 warning (shd)
	- added EP_Check3 support => more kris hatlelid songs work (shd)

2003-04-13:      no release

	- added HIP7 recognition to amifilemagic, so amberstar hippels
	  can now be played without renaming them... (mld)
	- fixes in Tim Follin subsong detection/switching for Puzznic (mld)

2003-02-15:      version 0.80-pre3-antiwar

	  - ems v6
	  - mcmd
	- improved players:
	  - Earache (EASO)
	  - Improved protracker clone and mmdc detection
	  - Magnetic Fields packer
	  - TomyTracker
	  - UltimateST
	- code cleanups
	- less debug messages to stderr
	- speed hack with uade.library for songs that require lots of
	  emulated cpu power (DIGIbooster, ArtOfNoise8, ems v6)
	- Alpha GNU/Linux testing with Alpha C-compiler was success 
	  (improved performance up to 33% with proper optimizations)
	- alpha alpha alpha support for Amplifiers (some songs already
	  work) but our amplifier system is totally flawed
	- added 16kB padding between reloc and module data to prevent a
	  bug in Hippel-COSO replay routine

2003-02-15:      no release
	- mcmd format content detection (mld)

2003-02-14:	no release
	- added 16kB padding between reloc and module data to prevent a
	  bug in Hippel-COSO replay routine (shd)
	- put "new" MCMD eagleplayer into players dir (shd)

2003-02-03:	no release
	- put new revisions of following Eagleplayers by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Magnetic Fields packer  (mld)
	- added ENPP_PokeCommand(). Thanks to Jan Blumenthal for info.
	  Jesper Olsen would now work if amplifier support was otherwise in
	  order (shd)
	- Added ENPP_SongEnd() for Laxity Player (and others) (shd)

2003-01-31:      no release
	- volume boost added to ems v6 (shd)
	- interrupt and songend fixed for UltimateST replayer. (mld)

2003-01-30:      no release
	- -sh enables the speed hack if it's really wanted for something
	  else than special cases (like ems v6) (shd)
	- updated following players to enable the speed hack too, fixing
	  speed or quality problems: DIGIbooster, ArtofNoise8 (mld)
	- --no-sh disables the speed hack. The amiga player can't request
	  speed hack if this switch is used. This is useful for testing
	  if a player really needs the speed hack. Speed hacks implications
	  are unknown at the moment. All properly coded players (do they
	  exist??) should work with speed hack. (shd)
	- Kimmo Kinnunen <kimmo.kinnunen@cs.tut.fi> provided us with a case
	  test and optimization flags for alpha gnu/linux. See INSTALL.alpha
	  and TESTING. These optimizations (with ccc) may provide up to 33%
	  performance improvement.
	- song end detection support for ems v6. i don't understand the
	  solution entirely so it might not work. needs to be tested. (shd)

2003-01-29:      no release
	- added ems v6 detection into amifilemagic.c (shd)
	- added a speed hack into uade for ems v6 songs: this makes all
	  instructions run in one cycle on a specified code interval. this
	  makes it possible to use higher mixing rates. see
	  amigasrc/players/ems/ems_new.s how to turn it on in player plugins
	  (it's used like amiga libraries (uade.library)) (shd)

2003-01-28:      no release
	- amifilemagic: fixed broken MMDC detection introduced by cleanups(mld)
	- thanks to sean connolly for giving us the source code for ems v6

	  started to work with --no-mc and score_38) (shd)
	- solaris fixes again: some solaris systems don't have $USER defined.
	  Switched to use getlogin(). If getlogin() returns zero then
	  getuid(). (shd)
	- fixed decrunch library make dependency hell (parallel build is still
	  broken: you have to run make -jX twice in order to compile) (shd)

2003-01-19:      no release
	- debugging improvements:
	  use u command in debugger to trace to some uade defined symbols.
	  for example:
	    >u
	      lists all known symbols
	    >u init sound
	      traces to a subroutine in sound core which calls InitSound()
	  (shd)
	- renamed debugger command u to l (shd)
	- added 'run until here again' command to debugger: u (shd)
	- moved all dtp_interrupt calls to supervisor state (shd)

2003-01-18:      no release
	  - finally fixed a 2.75 year old bug in uade booting process:
	    i didn't realize following things:
	      - chip memory was full of zeros in the beginning because i had
	        not removed kickstart booting process properly
	      - kickstart memory is mapped away from zero address
	        when CIA register bfe001 is hit in a certain way
	      - chip memory was mapped to zeros in CIA_reset()!!
	      - i thought i had a broken cpu emulation
	    the reason why this problem was not fixed was that i somehow
	    found a workaround for it with a good luck and didn't bother
	    to find out the real reason. (shd)
	  - due to boot process fix debugging with uae debugger is possible
	    again: just use -d option. ctrl-c switches to debugger in
	    debugging mode, hence it's not possible to switch songs (shd)
	  - amifilemagic.c: more trackerclone ID checks (mld)

2003-01-18:      version 0.80-pre1
	- changes relative to version 0.73:
	  - a new supported platform morphos
	  - better song end detection for (octa)med
	  - code cleanups
	  - enhanced (sub)song switching mechanisms
	  - changed (sub)song switching policies
	  - more intuitive xmms plugin settings
	  - solaris compilation and configuration fixes
	  - stonecracker crunched art of noise support

2003-01-18:      no release
	- AON 4ch replayer now also plays stonecracker packed files (mld)

2003-01-17:      no release
	- i hear morphos version produces sound: however i can't confirm it
	  (shd)
	- silence timeout can be set on the command line tool with -sit (shd)
	- InitPlayer() is not necessarily needed anymore for player plugins
	  (cust.pang-ingame didn't have that) (shd)
	- fixed configuration and compilation problems for Solaris:
	  - test -e => test -f in plugindir/Makefile.in
	  - removed useless (??) -c parameter for 'install' in
	    plugindir/Makefile.in
	  - separated strlcat and strlncat to not cause problems on platforms
	    that have native strlcat
	  (shd)
	- a work-around for morphos libnix braindamage (piru)

2003-01-16:      no release
	- started morphos / amigaos porting (piru, shd)

2003-01-15:      no release
	- added per subsong timeout (use -st on command line).
	  if requested timeout is reached the player skips to the next subsong
	  if such exists. if there are no subsongs left in the current song
	  it skips to the next song. (shd)
	- xmms plugin: "switch to next subsong on timeout" added.
	- xmms plugin: "switch to next subsong on songend" relabelled 
	              (tofkapsis: the option formerly known as play subsongs
		       in sequence)

2003-01-14:      no release
	- added silence detection into command line uade (shd)
	- added timeout option into command line uade (use -t or --timeout).
	  it skips to next entry in the song list if timeout is reached (it
	  does not go to the next subsong even if such is available).
	  default timeout is 10 minutes, which is stupid, but current command
	  line uade is inconvenient as a player anyway. use xmms. (shd)
	- fixed timeout option not to include slave mode (shd)

2003-01-08:      no release
	- MED/OctaMED songend routine corrections and fixes of stack overflows:
	  (mld,shd)
	- following cases should invoke a songend with MMD0,1,2:
	  - Sequence played through [MMD0,1]
	  - All sections and its sequences played through [MMD2]
	  - using FFE command [MMD0,1,2]
	  - Looping with B command [MMD0,1,2] (mld)

2003-01-07:      no release
	- better songend detection for MED/Octamed 4/8ch files. (mld)

2003-01-06:      no release
	- moved xmms plugin configuration variables into plugindir/defaults.c
	  (shd)

2003-01-06:      version 0.73
	- changes relative to version 0.72:
	  - ahx1/2 support
	  - (octa)med support (but not mmd3 yet)
	  - new and updated players:
	    - Janko Mrsic-Flogel (Greets to Don Adan / Wanted Team!)
	    - Soundcontrol (Don Adan)
	    - SoundImages (replaces old Tiny Williams) (Don Adan)
	    - SoundMaster (Don Adan)
	    - Steve Barrett (Don Adan)
	    - UniqueDevelopment -> BladePacker (Don Adan)
	    - Wally Beben (Don Adan)
	  - song database optimization
	  - irix support
	  - better support for package distributors
	  - interrupt system fixes (plays Turrican and many other correctly)
	  - better song end detection due supporting eagleplayer
	    modulechange() function
	  - improved silence detection (improves song end detection)
	  - better file info support

2003-01-05:      no release
	- (octa)med support (mld)
	- VBlankFrequency value of execbase is now set to 50Hz (shd)
	- removed stupid ChangeLog entries I made few minutes ago (shd)
	- did a work-around for the fucked up octamed player (don't use
	  $126(execbase) for any purpose! Only kernel should touch that)
	  (shd)

2003-01-02:      no release
	- xmms plugin: new page in GUI config for songend/timeout related
	  options (mld)
	- xmms plugin: "silence_timeout" is now configurable by the xmms
	  plugin's config GUI (mld)

2003-01-01:      hangover coding fun
        - happy new year.... Made the "silence_timeout" value configurable
	  from the xmms config file. No GUI config yet... I got headaches ;)
	  The value determines how long xmms should wait until it sees a
	  period of silence  as end of song.
	  It's in secs and defaults to 10. (mld)
	- can't remember what I did yesterday (shd)
	- silence timeout defaults to 20 seconds (shd's compromise)
	- precautionary song duration maximum defaults to 5 minutes (shd)

2002-12-31:      new year evening damage
	- shuffled few code lines, and removed something (shd ;-)

2002-12-28:      no release
	- code cleanups (shd)
	- what I did yesterday might not have been a good idea.. Wrote a new
	  song end detection system that might replace the one done yesterday
	  (shd)

2002-12-27:      no release
	- audxlch boredom: if following requirements are satisfied in a 30
	  second time interval, uade skips to the next (sub)song:
		 - no new values put into audxlch registers
		 - no non-zero values put into audxvol registers
	  This kludgy feature adds better-than-zero song end detection to at
	  least some songs. (shd)

2002-12-26:      no release
	- put new revisions of following Eagleplayers by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Steve Barrett (mld)
	- put new adaption of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Wally Beben. Thanks Don, almost like xmas ;)
	   (mld)

2002-12-03:      no release
	- xmms plugin: fixed content database bugs (shd)
	- xmms plugin: optimized database loading. initializations took about
	  800ms before and 30ms after optimizations. this was due to
	  horrible use of binary trees. I had inserted entries into tree in
	  sorted order causing the insertion to be O(n^2) operation!! (shd)

2002-12-02:      no release
	- xmms plugin: amifilemagic additions. (mld)
	- xmms plugin: modinfo parses now credits info for following formats:
	  Beathoven, Riff Raff, Dave Lowe, Howie Davies, Soprol, Fred Gray.
	  (mld)

2002-11-28:      no release
	- added a forgotten audio dma wait (shd)

2002-11-26:      no release
	- made epg_modulechange the default behaviour (still gives warnings
	  if a patch is applied) (shd)
	- put new revisions of following Eagleplayers by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Soundcontrol, SoundImages (=Tiny Williams),
	   SoundMaster (mld)
	- put new adaption of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Janko Mrsic-Flogel, Steve Barrett (mld)

2002-11-25:      no release
	- added a warning of 64-bit ULONG to src/decrunch/depack.c (this
	  must be fixed soon). This is non-fatal for 64-bit architectures
	  since powerpacked files are rarely distributed these days.
	  anyway, it's an easy fix. (shd)
	- changed some printfs to fprintfs. we must not output messages to
	  stdout since the user may want to use -outpipe 1. (shd)
	- fixed support for some misdetected GMC files (changed order of
	  tracker clone checks) (mld)
	- fixed epg_modulechange (shd)
	- traced sean connolly player anomaly to an unusual horizontal
	  sync waiting routine (dma wait) (shd)

2002-11-24:      no release
	- replaced depack.c with a more robust powerpacker decruncher.
	  (Thanks to Stuart Caie for the suggestion and the help!:)
	  (mld)
	- fixed nebulus2 custom song (added dos.library/CurrentDir()) (shd)
	  addition: nebulus2 fixes added support for Suntronic customs tunes.
	            just play them as real customs with the -P switch.

2002-11-22:      no release
	- new "make test" music. Thanks a lot to Pink/Abyss for letting us
	  use his song AHX.Cruisin as test tune.  (mld)

2002-11-21:      no release
	- major bug fix on open/dos.library: it does not set initial file
	  offset to zero when opening a file! This may affect all players
	  that read more than 1 files. (shd)
	- patched ahx replayer to load the ahx.waves location from ENV:
	  rather from S: (mld)
	- initial EPG_ModuleChange() implementation (EXPERIMENTAL!). Use
	  -mc switch to enable. We hope to detect if this feature causes
	  problems, fix them and then make this 'on' by default. (shd)
	- we got about 15 players to have song end detection working with
	  the EPG_ModuleChange() feature (mld, shd)

2002-11-20:      no release
	- put following player by Dexter/Abyss into players dir:
	  AHX (thanks to Bartman/Abyss for their permission:)
	- xmms plugin: extended fileinfo for AHX files (mld)
	- updated Makefile dependencies (shd)
	- replaced old UniqueDevelopment player with the new BladePacker
	  Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team. (mld)

2002-11-19:      no release
	- did my favourite stuff: fixed interrupt system.. this time ciab
	  interrupts.. THIS WILL PROBABLY BREAK SOMETHING! Now ciab.resource
	  allocated timer interrupt will pass a data pointer in a1 and exec
	  base in a6 to the user given interrupt function (shd)
	- added fake ciaa.resource(): it warns (to stderr) for
	  all operations except AddICRVector(). For AddICRVector() it
	  returns failure. This is useful because some players want to
	  allocate any cia timer, and sometimes they start by trying to
	  allocate a cia-a timer, then after that they try to allocate a
	  cia-b timer. (shd)
	- in the process got Martin Wodoks (Dexter/Abyss) AHX2 player working!
	  (shd)

2002-11-18:      no release
	- code cleanups (shd)

2002-11-16:      no release
	- added --package-prefix to configure to make it easier to distribute
	  binary distributions:
	  	  ./configure --prefix=/final/installation/path \
			      --package-prefix=/temporary/path
	  will install uade files into
	  /temporary/path/final/installation/path. When uade is run the
	  program assumes it has been installed to /final/installation/path.
	  (shd)
	- wav sound output will now produce little endian samples by default
	  on all platforms (shd)

2002-11-15:      no release
	- portability changes (mld)

2002-11-14:      no release
	- first port to IRIX/MIPS! That was hell. Thanks to flux for technical
	  and moral support.. (shd)

2002-11-12:      no release
	- more audio interrupt fixes (some players break rules). Automatic
	  subsong changing with Turrican 1 works again. (shd)


2002-11-11:      version 0.72
	- lots of new formats
	- lots of bug fixes
	- many improved versions of old players
	- security fixes
	- Turrican 2 and 3 (TFMX) songs are working finally!

2002-11-10:      no release
	- fixed uade audio interrupt system again! How many times can I
	  get it wrong?? I actually disassembled kickstart 3.0 rom
	  to see how the operating system would do the audio interrupt
	  handling. It really paid off: Turrican 2 seems to work now :) (shd)

2002-11-09:      no release
	- fixes for possible buffer overflows (shd)

2002-11-08:      no release
	- fixes for possible buffer overflows in xmms plugin's fileinfo (mld)

2002-11-07:      no release
	- improved Mr. Larmer's SUNTronic player (shd)

2002-11-06:      no release
	- code clean-ups and security fixes (shd)

2002-11-02:      no release
	- cleaned up shell flooding (shd)

2002-11-01:	no release
	- Protracker player now uses DTP_FormatName for reporting the modtype
	- xmmsplugin  displays the Formatname info in the fileinfo (mld)
	- did a work-around for a pathological case in audio emulation:
	  some players like to insert very small values into audxper hardware
	  registers, which is very stupid, but is done anyway. work-around
	  is that when a value 0 < v < 16 is inserted into audxper, uade
	  really inserts value 16 into audxper. example: robocop 2 highscore
	  song hit ones into audxper. (shd)

2002-10-31:	no release
	- fixed DTP_FormatName handling in sound core (has been _always_
	  totally broken). Corrected Darius Zendeh player to support
	  DTP_FormatName for the strange mod type added earlier. (shd)

2002-10-30:	no release
	- Modified Darius Zendeh player to support a new type (thanks to
	  Sunbeam). Fixed a subsong bug from Stephen's player. Big thanks to
	  Stephen Mifsud (Malta) for giving us the source code for his
	  player. (shd)

2002-10-25:	no release
	- put new revision of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	  into players dir: Jason Page (formerly known as JasonPageNew)
	  (mld)

2002-10-16:	no release

	  into players dir: MugicianII, TFMX Pro, TFMX 7V (mld)

2002-09-16:	no release

	- adapted Digibooster 1.x player for uade (mld)

2002-09-15:	no release

	- xmms plugin: extended fileinfo for M.O.N (mld)

2002-09-13:	no release
	- new commandline parameter "-one" for playing just one subsong
	  and signal songend when it's done. Useful for recording each
	  subsong indiviually. (shd)

2002-09-02:	no release
	- xmms plugin: extended fileinfo for TFMX, TFMX Pro and TFMX 7V (mld)

2002-08-31:	no release
	 - put new revision of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Peter Verswyvelen packer. (mld)

2002-08-22:	no release
	- made SDL audio output from uae 0.8.22 work with uade. This now
	  should it make possible to use uade on some other platforms, too.
	  To compile with SDL support use: ./configure --with-sdl (mld)

2002-08-04:      no release
	- fixed TFMX 7V detection for MDAT.B.C-Kid-Title (mld)

2002-07-25:      no release
	- fixed CUST.NeverWhere_Loader HUNK_SYMBOL bug in sound core.
	  Thanks to Nicolas** for reporting the bug (shd)

2002-07-17:	no release
	- fixed a non-fatal double load bug that occured in a case when
	  only playername was given with -P playername from cmdline (shd)

2002-06-28:	no release
	- xmms ignores now the last extension if the filename ends with
	  .gz, .bz2 or .pp (mld)
	- support for one-file TFMX files by using Alexis NASR's alternative
	  TFMX eagleplayer. Beware UADE has a lot of problems with these
	  replayers. So, using the original two file MDAT, SMPL is always
	  better. (both features suggested by Simon Hosie) (mld)

2002-06-19:	no release
	- added optional support for creating MIME-info rules for the
	  ROX filemanager. [http://rox.sf.org] (mld)

2002-06-05:	version 0.71
	 - lots of new players (lots of thanks to Don Adan / Wanted Team!)
	 - improved many players (same as above)
	 - more portability (included uade rpm spec for the uade distribution)
	 - better documentation
	 - separate master volume setting for uade played songs under xmms

2002-05-26:	no release
	 - put new adaption of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Desire. (mld)
	 - put Ultimate Soundtracker player into contrib/players-unstable.
	   (mld)

0200-04-272:	no release
	 - put new adaption of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Special_FX. (mld)
	 - put new revision of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: Soundcontrol. (mld)

0200-04-222:	no release
	- added warning if lha executable is missing when running configure
	  script: NOTE THAT LHA IS NOT A REQUIREMENT (shd)

2002-04-16:	no release
	- xmms plugin configuration now also has brief little help tooltips.
	  Anyway read the docs. The tooltips are not meant as a replacment but
	  for some further explanation. ;) (mld)

2002-04-15:	no release
	 - changed default behaviour of -P parameter: now it forces the
	   given playername for all songs that are played from the command
	   line (shd)
	 - put following Replayers by Sunbeam/Shelter into players dir:
	   MarkCooksey (new), MarkCookseyOld, TinyWilliams   (mld)

2002-04-07:	no release
	 - added a feature I don't want to explain or document. this
	   feature is only for hardcore uade users. (hint: cd contrib;
	   make songtool) (shd)

2002-04-06:       no release
	 - added volume gain feature into xmms plugin: now it's possible
	   to increase or decrease volume exclusively for uade played songs.
	   for example many mp3s play with lower volume than typical amiga
	   songs. it can be nice to decrease the volume for amiga songs
	   by setting the volume gain parameter lower than 100% from the
	   uade configure window. if you set the volume gain more than 100%
	   you will probably get the overdrive effect (for which many would
	   say is not nice) (shd)

2002-04-04:       no release
	 - clears 1st megabyte of chipmem when starting to play a new song
	   (work around for delta music random song failures) (shd)

2002-03-28:       no release
	 - added -h and --help for uade command line tool (shd)

2002-03-27:	no release
	 - fixed 'make install': subdirectories of 'players' directory were
	   not installed (players/ENV:EaglePlayer for example) (shd)

2002-03-23:	no release
	 - put new revisions of following Eagleplayers by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: TFMX, TFMX_Pro (+ cfg file for using DMA wait)
	   (mld)
	 - put new adaption of following Eagleplayer by Don Adan/Wanted Team
	   into players dir: TFMX 7V (+ cfg file for using 20Khz for mixing)
	 - Updated amifilemagic to recognize TFMX V7 mods. (mld)

2002-03-19	no release

	  it forces xmms plugin to be installed to directory DIRECTORY (shd)

2002-03-17:	no release
	- xmms plugin: thread safety for xmms 1.2.7+ file type check
	  (there seems to be some strange crashes when directories are added
	  to the playlist) (shd)

2002-02-22:	no release
	- put new revisions of following Eagleplayers by Wanted team into
	  players dir: PaulShields, TME, MugicianII (+ a cfg file for best
	  mixing) (mld)

	- more working custom songs
	- sc68 container support
	- more portable configuration system
	- PA-RISC support

2002-02-03:	no release
	- removed obsolete "playuade" frontend. Use "uade" instead for the
	  same functionality now.

2002-02-03:	no release
	- added incomplete check for Whittaker(type1/4) to amifilemagic (mld)

2002-02-01:	no release
	- added Pumatracker, fixed MON detection in amifilemagic (mld)
	- committed sc68rip tool into /contrib	(mld)

	  Eagleplayers: PumaTracker, PaulSummers (mld)

2002-01-26:	no release
	- uade executable for PA-RISC works! xmms plugin not yet tested
	  (wav output works with sd-sound-file.c except that bytes have
	  to be swapped for samples later)

2002-01-25:	no release
	- added some #include headers for portability (a test on Debian
	  GNU/Linux on PA-RISC) (decrunch stuff needed #include <string.h>
	  for memcpy()) (shd)

2002-01-24:      no release
	- added exec.library/TypeOfMem() to make TFMX_7v eagleplayer not crash
	  (timing doesn't still work) (shd)
	- added level6 interrupt hack to make CUST.The_Plague work! The fault
	  was in the custom module. It did not use proper functions to setup
	  hardware interrupts. (shd)
	- added more ciab.resource hacks to make CUST.An_Unbidden_Eye work..
	  I'm avoiding the inevitable: ciab.resource has to be done well
	  eventually (shd ;-)

2002-01-22:	no release
	- better CTRL-C handling for uade: if 2 ctrl-c signals arrive in the
	  same timeframe shorter than 0.1 seconds the playing is stopped (shd)

	  set it with SetIntVector/exec.library did not get INTENA & INTREQ
	  in d1 as parameter => Benn Daglish player works now (shd)

2002-01-10:       no release

	  pipe or as standalone tool for identifying a file. (mld)
	- updated playuade to use uadetect instead of echo|sed (mld)
	  this should now fix some formats that couldn't be played by
	  playuade before like Startrekker mods, TFMX1.5

	  deliplayer (why the hell would they disable ALL hw interrupts
	  in DTP_InitSound?) (shd)
	- added loadseg()/dos.library to uade sound core => DaveLowe seems
	  to work ... Dave Lowe used some undocumented function pointer
	  that I couldn't find from delitracker api, so I just put a trivial
	  return program there;) The song sounds okay anyway.. hehe (shd)
	- added and replaced following with Eagleplayers by Wanted Team:

	    skipped when using wildcards, (mld)
	- xmms plugin: sequential subsong is now also selectable when either
	  just timeout or just songend is checked. 
	  (had to be both enabled before)

	- FreeBSD compile cleanups (#include <values.h> -> <limits.h>)

2001-12-06:	no release
	- configure changes (thanks to Meleth!)

2001-12-05:	version 0.52

	- added shared content database support (for make sysinstall)

2001-12-03:	version 0.51
	- Finally!

2001-12-02:      no release
	- Added panning support into UADE input plugin. This could be useful
	  for those who use headphones and don't like the extreme stereo
	  effect. It can be enabled in the configure menu.
	     0% => no effect
	   100% => mono

2001-11-26:	no release
	- improved exec.library/SetIntVector() handling
	  => CUST.FA18Interceptor works!
	  (with good luck other new songs started to work)

	- lots of code cleanups

2001-11-24:	no release
	- song end support for Hippel-COSO

2001-11-23:	no release
	- song duration database system: UADE has become a learning system.
	  UADE knows lengths of songs from experience which can be obtained
	  by playing songs and/or copying song duration databases from
	  external sources. Combining 2 different databases is easy, see
	  the documentation (if available;). For those who don't have
	  knowledge of exotic Amiga formats let it be told that for many
	  formats there is no easy way to predict song duration without
	  playing the song to the end (assuming the end even exists).
	- song end support for Hippel

2001-11-19:	no release
	- switched UAE default configuration to 68020 emulation from 68000
	  emulation => THX deliplayer works (and perhaps some other)
		    => CUST.EndlessPiracy works (it's 68000 code but doesn't
		       work on real A500 for some strange reason)
	  Our policy will be to maintain 68000 compability where ever
	  possible (sound core will only contain 68000 code)

2001-11-17:	no release
	- implemented exec.library/Cause() software interrupt OS call

2001-11-15:	no release
	- maintaining code.. i'm beginning to really hate plugindir/deli.c
	  module (needs cleanups badly!)

2001-11-09:	no release
	- new replayer: Paul Summers (replaces VectorDean and Richard Joseph)
	- more file content recognition code

2001-11-07:	no release
	- timeout bug fixed (uade played timeout + buffered seconds, now
	  it plays timeout + few milliseconds)

2001-11-06:	no release
	- sequential subsong bug fixed (skipped subsongs)

2001-11-05:	no release
	- sequential subsongs feature added:
	   - option in configure is 'play subsongs in sequence'
	   - default setting off
	   - if the option is on, subsongs in a song are played sequentially
	   - if the option is on, plugin jumps to the next entry in the
	     playlist when all subsongs have been played (not totally
	     accurate description, there are exceptions of course;)

2001-11-04:	no release
	- song end system improved (not very informative but very relevant)

2001-11-03:	no release
	- new player: NovoTradePacker (thanks to Wanted Team!)
	- improved PTK-Prowiz (sounds funny but subsong detection is improved
	  see the documentation (some people have hidden songs in protracker
	  modules))
	- song format detection by file content improved

2001-10-24:	version 0.50

2001-10-22:	no release
	- lots of code cleanups
	- new user documentation in uade-docs/
	- new deliplayers: Amos, PierreAdane

2001-10-18:	no release
	- improved sub song recognition & handling
	- runs on Solaris, even under XMMS!

2001-10-08:	no release
	- dtg_SetTimer() finally done! Previous tempo problems should be fixed
	- Improved/new deliplayers:
	  ASReplay, ImagesMusicSystem, Soundfactory, SoundFX, THX, TME

2001-09-07:	version 0.40
	- Multifile loading support (VectorDean, TFMX, YMPlayer, ...)
	- Song end support for PTK-Prowiz deliplayer (for protracker +
	  variants)
	- Optimized playlist scanning

2001-09-04:	no release
	- Added song end checking to PTK-Prowiz deliplayer (mod player)
	- Optimized playlist file scanning by caching 'uadeformats' file
	- 'uadeformats' caching can be turned on/off from configure menus
	- Lots of small changes to make UADE function faster under XMMS
	- Deliplayers can now use case-insensitive fileloading (compability
	  issue from AmigaOS). This is very usefull with YMPlayer and TFMX*.

2001-08-27:	no release
	- YMPlayer works much better! (I still don't like ATARI ST sounds)
	- Hippel-COSO improvements
	- TFMX, TFMX_1.5, TFMXPro improvements: many of the TFMX play OK
	  (I hate TFMX system!!)
 
2001-08-25:	no release
	- multifile loading support (DTP_ExtLoad) => new formats supported:
	  VectorDean, TFMX 1.5 and TFMX Pro (probably more)

2001-08-18:	version 0.30
	- updated configuration system:
	  use ./configure and then manually edit config.h if needed
	- players improved: ptk-prowiz for protracker clones, Soundfactory,
	  Dawe Lowe New, MarkII and others..
	- uade is now compatible with xmms crossfade plugin
	- optional (experimental) players in contrib/players-unstable
	  (includes ptk-prowiz for playing about 51 protracker variants)

2001-05-24:	no release
	- a patch from michael bouillot which disables uade's subsong
	  changing mechanism to change subsongs with a remote control (without
	  mouse).. michael doering applied this patch to the plugin by making
	  it optional (see configure/GUI)

2001-04-22:	no release
	- improved subsong reporting
	- improved global installation system

2001-04-20:	no release
	- fixed a serious bug involving song format recognition in m68k
	  sound core (fortunately most people use force by default option
	  which disables song format recognition)
	- added true global installation system

2001-04-19:	version 0.21
	- removed some of the sound bugs (concerns song and subsong changing)
	- added new players (now supports at least 90 formats)

2001-04-17:	no release
	- subsong changing bug fixed ('defender of the crown' subsongs work
	  now on xmms plugin)

2001-04-15:	version 0.20
	- new players & bug fixes

2001-02-20:	no release (version 0.20-pre2)
	- NTSC/PAL bug fixed
	- private xmms plugins for different users supported in install scripts

2001-02-08:	no release (version 0.20-pre1)
	- NTSC/PAL option can be changed from gui preferences
	- NTSC can be forced from cmdline with -ntsc

2000-11-27:	version 0.10c
	- UADE should work on FreeBSD 4.x now!
	  (fixed src/Makefile and plugindir/Makefile)

2000-11-21:	versio 0.10b
	- fixed a Makefile bug that probably affected people who upgraded
	  UADE from an older version
	- put a proper version number into XMMS plugin:)

2000-11-09:	version 0.10
	- the GUI for XMMS plugin has been activated
	- primitive fileinfo is now possible on XMMS plugin
	- UADE plugin can be configured from XMMS preferences
	- Subsongs can be changed easier now! Just click on the slider bar..
	- Now supports about 75 players! I don't want to count them manually.
	  I'll probably add automatic player counter into XMMS GUI in the
	  future.
	- got rid of the bloody pipe system that was used to transmit sound
	  data from emulator to xmms plugin! Now uses RING-BUFFERING (more
	  robust and efficient)
	- I've been hacking a lot with the XMMS plugin, and improving sound
          core too (that's why all those new players)

2000-08-24:	version 0.02
	Subsong changing for XMMS plugin added! Read the README for more
	details.

2000-08-22:	version 0.01h
	Lots of small changes to code. Mainly changes considering code
	maintainability. This release has no new features. Added a
	configuration window into XMMS plugin. It doesn't really do anything
	yet.

2000-07-25:	no release
	Added song's filename & playername into XMMS windows scroller. Set's
	song length to TIMEOUT if timeout value is defined for songs in
	~/.xmms/deliconfig. Renamed shd_* variables and functions into
	uade_* variables and functions.

2000-07-12:	no release
	Removed some X86 machine dependencies. M68k-emulation is still
	depending on X86 processor. This shouldn't be very hard to fix,
	but I don't know how to compile generic version of gencpu.c so that
	it creates proper cpuemu.c.

2000-05-08:	version 0.01g
	Added new features to xmms plugin: If song playes ZERO stream
	continuously for 30 seconds, the plugin will change song. This is a
	good feature for those formats that don't have proper songend signal.
	If soundcore crashes or stops at deadend, the plugin will also change
	the song.

2000-04-28:	version 0.01f (Second Freshmeat release on 28.4.2000)
	Fixed bugs in xmms plugin. Now it doesn't jam xmms so often unless
	you hit play or next button repeatedly too fast.

2000-04-25:	version 0.01e
	Got message from delitracker authors about deliplayer copyright
	issues. Hence all the previous distributions are removed from the
	website => NEW RELEASE.

2000-04-24:	no release
	Added -execdebug switch to monitor usage of exec.library functions
	in deliplayers. Why am I telling this to you ? You don't need
	to know about this stuff ;-) Anyway, if someone reports a crash
	on Custom module, using this switch might (should!) give information
	about the crash...

2000-04-22:	version 0.01d
	Added AddIntServer() and timer.device and some IO functions into
	sound core. At least 2 new custom songs work now: cust.james-pond-2
	and cust.defender_of_the_crown. However, the problem with j-p-2 is
	that subsongs must be changed dynamically during playing which
	is not possible now in uade because there is no good user interface.

2000-04-21:	no release
	Added a sensible posix compliant tempname for shared memory maps
	between uade and xmms plugin. XMMS plugin creates the memory
	map file on initialization and UADE destroys it when XMMS plugin
	has been terminated. XMMS Inputplugins don't have a cleanup
	routine as far as I know (not too far?-) so this had to be done in
	an annoying way.

2000-04-20:	no release
	Hacked with David Whittaker player. It seems that Whittaker
	player is very flawed. I had to make some module format checking.
	I hope in future we have a whittaker player in Uade that plays
	all the modules... The problem is that there are so many 
	variations of Whittaker modules out there. Each module has it's
	own header :(

2000-04-12:	version 0.01c (first Freshmeat release on 13.4.2000)
	For some strange reason, I got crashes on virtual Amiga if I
	compiled newcpu.c with -O2 option. Now I compile newcpu.c
	without -O2 option and it works. (this was on gcc 2.95.2)

2000-04-10:	version 0.01b
	src/Makefile fixes (SMP support, thanks to flux !)

2000-04-09:	version 0.01
	Initial test-and-crash release. Loads of irritating debug messages.
	Annoying crashes with plugin. Too effortful installation.
